This project presents the implementation of a collaborative filtering recommendation system using matrix factorization techniques, specifically leveraging the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) algorithm, to predict user preferences based on past interactions. Recommendation systems have become crucial in many online platforms such as e-commerce, streaming services, and social media to provide personalized content and improve user engagement. The main objective of this project is to build a model that can accurately estimate a user’s rating for items they have not yet interacted with by analyzing existing user-item rating patterns. To facilitate ease of use and eliminate dependencies on external datasets, the project uses a small synthetic dataset created within the notebook itself. This dataset consists of a few sample users, items, and their associated ratings, structured into a tabular format compatible with Python’s data processing tools. The project employs the Surprise library, a specialized Python package designed for building and evaluating recommendation algorithms, alongside Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib for visualizing the results. Initially, the sample dataset is converted into a format recognized by Surprise using the Reader class, with explicit definition of the rating scale to ensure correct interpretation. The dataset is then split into training and testing subsets to enable evaluation of the model’s predictive accuracy on unseen data, simulating real-world scenarios where recommendations are made for unknown items. The core of the project involves training the SVD model on the training data. SVD is a powerful matrix factorization method that decomposes the user-item rating matrix into latent features representing underlying user preferences and item attributes. By capturing these latent relationships, the model is capable of predicting missing ratings effectively, even in sparse data situations where many ratings are unknown. Once trained, the model generates predictions on the test set, estimating ratings that users might assign to items they have not yet rated. To quantify the model’s performance, two standard error metrics—Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE)—are computed by comparing predicted ratings to actual test ratings. These metrics provide insight into the average magnitude of prediction errors and are widely used in the recommendation system community for benchmarking models. The results are further illustrated through a bar chart visualization, which offers an intuitive summary of the evaluation metrics, making it easier to interpret model accuracy at a glance. This project not only demonstrates a complete end-to-end workflow for building a recommendation system but also highlights the practical use of matrix factorization techniques in collaborative filtering tasks. While the current implementation uses a small, manually created dataset to avoid network and access issues, the methodology can be scaled to real-world datasets like MovieLens or e-commerce transaction logs, making it applicable in commercial scenarios. By focusing on simplicity and clarity, this project serves as an excellent learning tool for beginners aiming to understand the fundamental concepts behind recommendation engines, collaborative filtering, and latent factor models. Moreover, it lays the groundwork for exploring more advanced techniques such as hyperparameter tuning, hybrid recommendation models, and integrating additional contextual or user-item metadata. Overall, the project showcases how Python and the Surprise library provide a robust and user-friendly environment to experiment with recommendation algorithms, reinforcing the importance of recommendation systems in today’s data-driven applications and emphasizing the role of machine learning in personalizing digital experiences.
